# Heroic Games Launcher
Heroic is an open source alternative to the Epic Games Store. You can read more about it and how to use it [here](https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher#readme).

This project provides build artifacts for packaging Heroic for Solus Linux. If you want to use Heroic on Solus, you've come to the right place. 

# Installation
## From .eopkg Release
1. Download the latest .eopkg from [releases](https://github.com/mdmellor/heroic-games-solus/releases).
2. Open a terminal and `cd` to the directory where the file was downloaded.
3. Install using `sudo eopkg it heroic-games-launcher-X.X.X-X-X-x86_64.eopkg`. 

## Building from Source
If for whatever reason you want to build from source, you can follow [these instructions](https://getsol.us/articles/packaging/building-a-package/en/) to package your own .eopkg file. 

# Credits
Thanks to Harvey on the Solus forums for teaching me how this all works. It would have taken me much longer to get this done without his help.

Additional thanks to the writers of the [Solus Packaging documentation](https://getsol.us/articles/packaging/).
