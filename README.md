# Heroic Games Launcher
Heroic is an open source alternative to the Epic Games Store. You can read more about it and how to use it [here](https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher#readme).

> **NOTE**: This project is now maintained on the [Solus portal](https://dev.getsol.us/source/heroic-games-launcher/). I don't update this page all that often anymore. If you want to view the source files for this project, go there. 
> I also don't really post releases here anymore. You should get them from `eopkg`/ Software Center instead. 

# Installation
## From Software Center
Open the Software Center and search for "heroic-games-launcher". Click install. Enjoy!

## From Terminal
Open a terminal and execute `sudo eopkg it heroic-games-launcher`.

## Building from Source
If for whatever reason you want to build from source, you can follow [these instructions](https://getsol.us/articles/packaging/building-a-package/en/) to package your own .eopkg file. 

# Credits
Thanks to Harvey on the Solus forums for teaching me how this all works. It would have taken me much longer to get this done without his help.

Additional thanks to the writers of the [Solus Packaging documentation](https://getsol.us/articles/packaging/).
